# Pykkachu

A convenience library on top of Pykka and PySM to help with common Actor Model patterns.
[Github](https://github.com/amcknight/pykkachu)

## To Do
- Expand to work with all Actor types instead of just ThreadingActors
- Create a config loader for wiring up simple Actors
- Better encapsulate Pykka and PySM so they are not imported by users of the library unless it makes sense to

## Changelog
- Pulled a Message class in from [gab](https://github.com/amcknight/gab)
